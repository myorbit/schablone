- add documentation, also in comment in generic class

considerations:
- build core-functionality (expand the functionality of svglue and svgutils massively)
  - use id instead of template-id
  - change color and fonts by svglue
  - make software more responsive and scaleable (recourses) by core functionality (What must be done to be able to use it in backend django apps?)
    - create packages that melts and massively extends the functionality of svglue and svgutils
    - by that way prevent the numerous time consuming store actions
  - think about rendering svgs (rsvg)

- insert resume software
  - is generic.py then generic for label?

- add ability to read json 

- svglue
  - add ability to change more properties (font properties, colors, ...)
  - use id instead of template-id (since this can be changed by inkscape)
  - document change id by inkscape or by text-editor  

- add function that can add qr-codes to pdf files

Schablone extensively exploits the flexibility of xml formats like svg and html (not yet). It is based on svglue, svgutils and lxml (yet indirectly)
